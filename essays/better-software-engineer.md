### How can I be a better software engineer?
  As of now, I know little to nothing about software engineering, having not had much experience working with design and maintenance of software, or even just building software itself. As of now, some of my interests might be learning how to create/use simple frameworks for software, how to utilize a database and use it efficiently, and also just overall improving my programming skills. While these
arent all of the skills that I'd like to learn, they seem to highlight/contain the majority of concepts that seem to be the most vital to software engineering. However, there are many more skills that contribute to being a complete software engineer, so this is very subjective. 

### Improving programming skills 
While programming is not the entirety of software engineering, it seems to be a commonly used tool, and my programming skills right now seem to be a little lackluster in my eyes. However, I believe that programming will most likely come in due time, since it seems to be the most utilized of all the skills in software engineering. While that seems to be a pretty common goal, it is definitely
a sensible one to have.

### Utilizing frameworks
  As for frameworks, I would like to see how they are generally used, which we will probably get to later in this class. Using things like "frameworks" and "databases" are very foreign concepts to me, despite how many times I've heard them in passing conversation among students and people on the internet. Truly understanding what they are and working with them is displayed as a very daunting task
to me, however from what I've seen online they seem to be a very helpful tool with writing stuff, such as debugging, saving you time from writing things from scratch, along with a whole host of beneficial tools, which I am pretty excited to see in action.


### Working with databases
  Databases are also something that seem a little abstract to me aswell, with the main concept of it seemingly being the management, organization, and structural representation of data. While we work with "data" in most programs we write, databases seem to be way more complex in nature, and seem to be a completely different beast management wise. In time I hope to become proficient and experienced
with working with databases.
