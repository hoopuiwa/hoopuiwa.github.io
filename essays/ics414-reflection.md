# ICS 414: Reflection on expectations and reality  
  Now that the semester is coming to an end, I think that now of all times would be the perfect time to share some of my thought process, failures and successes, and my overall experience from this class. It's been a very insightful experience, showing me a lot about myself, what some of my weaknesses are,
  and what the most important takeaway for this class was. While not very satisfied or pleased with my own performance in the class, which was completely all on my end, I believe that I could've done a lot of things better, not just software related but through team communication, time management, and overall
  responsibility. But before that, I think it would be best to sort of explain this whole story from the beginning:

## ICS 314 part 2?
  Having just finished ICS 314 last semester, when I saw this class available for this semester I was very intrigued, questioning whether or not I should take it. I had some pretty rough turns during ICS 314, mostly due to poor preparation and discipline, but nevertheless, having 
  heard a lot from my ICS 314 professor about how much more in depth this class was, I made up my mind and decided to enroll. When first walking into the classroom for the first time, I was completely just expecting a vaguely reminiscent experience of ICS 314: more framework/template practice, 
  more WOD's, etc. But as soon as I sat down, me and the whole class were met with a pretty shocking revelation: no quizzes, no lectures, no homeworks, and crazily enough, no WODs! Only one thing was due this semester, that being... a single project, specifically a financial analysis application for a company called Spire Hawaii (A real client!). I think most of us were pretty taken aback by that, 
  but to me it sounded actually pretty promising. As Professor Moore had told us, this was essentially (almost) a freebie A: stay consistent, and you'll pass. However, for me, I knew I would have to really push through and keep myself on task to really get through this. No week by week WOD's to 
  atleast force me to slightly study, just pure, independent responsibility. After the first couple days, we eventually had to form teams, and, similar to the end of last semesters ICS 314 class where we also had to develop a project, I knew that there was a whole lot more I'd have to learn for this class. 

## Back to the past
  With the majority of my team members having been out of ICS 314 for a while now, I was pretty much the fresh meat in the group. Having realized that my ICS 314 class was the first to switch to a new tech stack (postgreSQL for databases and next.js for app development), I quickly realized I was in the minority
  for the vote. However, I never really voiced against using Meteor and MongoDB (the old tech stack), as why should I inconvenience my whole team of 7 people to learn the new tech stack when it could just be me doing the switch? It would be way more comfortable for the team to work with something they're familiar with,
  so I just decided I had to suck it up and experiment with the meteor app template we were provided. After looking up the documentation, it seemed pretty similar to the nextjs app: similar compiling and run commands, etc. However, the biggest difference was in the file directory structure: different routing style, schema validations,
  tags, even the user account and password tokenization was different as well. I got pretty nervous as I basically thought, "I gotta teach myself essentially what I learned in the latter portion of ICS 314 within these first few days". It actually went pretty smoothly, as I just sort of looked at the content of what my teammates were committing,
  adding pages, user roles, and just sort of worked out the file dependency, structure, and organization for myself. It was a pretty good test to see how much I could learn about this new environment and I'm pretty pleased with it. However, little did I know that code development-specific problems were the least of my worries...

## A lesson in finance: Tables, graphs, and more tables
  As our main goal was to make an application that could confidently display, modify, and assess certain financial information (primarily business related costs and also relevant generated forecasts from current financial data), we knew we had two main problems here in terms of development: 
  Learn how this stuff works, and implement it through code.
