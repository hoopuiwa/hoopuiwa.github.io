# Maunawili lo'i adventure

A couple of years ago, I remember being woken up abruptly by my mom one day, asking if I wanted to help clean up a lo'i. While the rest of my family already had the privilege of going numerous times in the past, this would be my first time going. Not really knowing
what to expect, I decided to take her up on her offer and accompany them to the lo'i, with the only advice from my mom being "dont wear anything nice", something I'm grateful I took seriously (not sure if i even have those clothes in the pictures below anymore).
After scrounging around my photo albums on my phone for a bit, I managed to encounter some pictures of the experience. We also got to take some Kalo cuttings to take home and plant in our backyard, which was a pretty nice gift aswell! (Pretty sure they died like 2 weeks later).
