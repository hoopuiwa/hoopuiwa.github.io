# Rock and weed removal from our land in Kunia
  For some background context, me and my family own some land in Kunia, with some current plans to move there. However, things don't always go as planned, as our original estimate was that we'd move there in around 2 years, which was around 2022, 
  and as of now in 2024 there are no plans for a house yet over there, as its pretty much just mostly barren dirt. However, when we were originally preparing, the whole plot of land was absolutely overflowing with pretty much ever weed you could name,
  most annoyingly the colloquially named "California grass", which as most of the people who live here know, is an absolute pain to deal with. The plan was to chop down the trees, pull out and cut the weeds, and remove the boulders and rocks on the plot to 
  clear it for dirt compaction. We mostly used weedwackers and shears to deal with the majority of weeds, along with some long sleeved shirts and pants for good coverage, along with gloves to protect our hands, since most of the weeds were pretty sharp and rough. 
  For the trees, which was actually a lot of fun, we mostly used machetes and shovel axes. For the boulders and rocks however, we mostly had to deal with that after majority of the foliage was removed, since it was so dense you couldn't even see them, requiring especially
  heavy duty vehicles and equipment to properly dispose of them. It was a pretty fun experience, and although it took nearly the entire day for the first part, it was pretty successful, having cleared a majority of the land out. Watching the excavators remove some of the rocks
  was also awesome, but also sort of sketchy aswell.

## Current plans
  While the majority of the plants and rocks have been removed, and the dirt compaction finished, theres still a little bit of paperwork we have to deal with, along some land issues. However, once that gets settled, were pretty excited to start planning out and building
  the house, which we really want to make sure we design well. I think that moving there will be a big change in my life, but one that I think I'll be accepting of. Anyways, heres a picture of the land after we removed some of the stuff!
